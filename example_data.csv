We would like to take this opportunity to wish you continued good health and well-being. Samsung  Electronics  is  doing  its  best  to  promptly  respond  to  the  COVID-19  crisis  that  is affecting the world. As  part  of  quarantine  measures,  we  analyzed  the  unprecedented  crisis  quickly  and  are actively preventing the spread of the disease among our employees as well as the workers of our suppliers. From a business management perspective, we are committed to minimizing the business impacts of the pandemic by working to ensure that there are no interruptions to the operation of the supply chain that stretches from raw materials to customers. Moreover, in line with our CSR Vision, ‘Together for Tomorrow!’, which launched last year, we stand side by side with the communities that are struggling with COVID-19 and continue to provide sup- port so they can overcome the crisis. Meanwhile we remain steadfast in our efforts to contribute to the global economy by creating innovative technologies and products. The Consumer Electronics (CE) Division is enhancing customers' lifestyles with products such as QLED 8K TVs, the Sero TVs, and BESPOKE refrig- erators. The IT & Mobile Communications (IM) Division has maintained its No. 1 position in smartphones by launching foldable phones, and continues to remain at the forefront of the next-generation telecommunication market by commercializing 5G for the first time in the world. The Device Solutions (DS) Division continues to lead the semiconductor industry by introducing the highest-level innovative technologies, such as the third-generation 10-nano class DRAM, the 108 million pixel image sensor, and EUV process. Samsung Electronics celebrated its 50th-anniversary last year. As we take our first steps into the next half-century, we are acutely aware of our obligations and roles in sustainable opera- tions. As a global corporate citizen, Samsung Electronics will continue to create environmen- tal and social values while achieving positive economic outcomes. To this end, we are expanding environmentally conscious investments in production facilities to strengthen our climate change response activities. We are also promoting ways to improve the  Earth's  environment  through  initiatives  such  as  establishing  the  ‘Samsung  Particulate Matter Research Institute’. To minimize the environmental impact of our products, we will continue our efforts in extending their life cycle and reducing electronic waste. We  will  be  more  prudent  to  the  potential  social  impact  of  our  products  and  services  with regard to personal information protection and cybersecurity, and will strengthen our activ- ities to protect and improve the workplace environment of our employees and those of our suppliers. Samsung Electronics takes the responsibility of transparent corporate structure and ethical management seriously. In support of this, we appointed an Independent Director as the chair of the Board of Directors for the first time, and established a Samsung Compliance Commit- tee with related companies. We will continually strive to operate a world-class governance and compliance management system. Although our daily lives are undergoing rapid changes because of COVID-19, through solidar- ity and cooperation, Samsung Electronics will successfully overcome the challenges the pan- demic has brought us. To leave a great legacy as a ʻsustainable centennial companyʼ for future generations, Samsung Electronics is dedicated to creating innovative products and services based on a bold and can-do spirit, and to contributing to the societal development as a ʻsus- tainable first-class companyʼ. We thank you for your continued interest and ask for your unyielding support.

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, OTOS Wing donated KRW 50 million to the Community Chest of Korea to return the support it received from the Smart Factory Support Program to society. In addition, the company donated 400 pairs of medical goggles and 100 eye shields to the City of Daegu as well as 5,000 pairs of medical goggles to the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. Meanwhile, NJ Company, a hand sanitizer manufacturer that benefited from our Smart Factory Support Program in 2019, boosted its monthly output from 5 tonnes to 200 tonnes after receiving coaching on its overall manufacturing process, evading the risk of going out of business. NJ Company also donated 10,000 bottles of hand sanitizers to the Korea Federation of SMEs, and is sounding out a global donation through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
